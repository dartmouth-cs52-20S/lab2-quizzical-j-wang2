I designed a pretty basic buzzfeed-style quiz with javascript focus, where I wrote functions to populate the HTML with values from a 'data.json' file.

Something I struggled with initially was css styling for answer tiles and the questions - while those are still apparent in the v1 tagged version (pre-js focus), I addressed many of those css styling issues in the more recent commits. I checked with Professor Tregubov and he said it was OK to not retag a new hard-coded HTML commit with the updated styling.

I dont think that I have any particular screencaps worth pointing out that are not visible on the hosted github pages site already.
